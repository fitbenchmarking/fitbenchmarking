FitBenchmarking is an open source tool for comparing different
minimizers/fitting frameworks based on their accuracy and runtimes.

FitBenchmarking is cross platform and should install and run on Windows,
Linux and Mac OS. As of this writing the tool does not have instructions
and/or code for setting it up to run on specialised hardware.
  
For questions, requests etc. don’t hesitate to contact us on

the Getting Started page.

What the tool does
------------------

The tool creates a table/tables that shows a comparison between the
different minimizers available in a fitting software (e.g. scipy or
mantid), based on their accuracy and/or runtimes. An example of a table
is:
   
.. figure:: ../images/example_table.png
	    :alt: Example Table
      
This is the result of fitbenchmarking mantid on a set of neutron data.
The results are normalised with respect to the best minimizer per
problem. The problem names link to html pages that display plots of the
data and the fit that was performed, together with initial and final
values of the parameters. Here is an example of the final plot fit.
