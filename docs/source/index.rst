FitBenchmarking is an open source tool for comparing different
minimizers/fitting frameworks based on their accuracy and runtimes.

FitBenchmarking is cross platform and should install and run on Windows,
Linux and Mac OS. As of this writing the tool does not have instructions
and/or code for setting it up to run on specialised hardware.

For questions, requests etc. donâ€™t hesitate to contact us on
