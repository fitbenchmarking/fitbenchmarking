Adding Fitting Problem Definition Types
#######################################


**Fitting problem definition types currently supported**

The types (formats) that are currently supported are:

  - Native (Fitbenchmark)
    This supports functions/data from Mantid or SasView
  - NIST

An example of these formats can be seen in
``benchmark_problems/Neutron_data/``/``benchmark_problems/SAS_modelling/``
and ``benchmark_problems/NIST/`` respectively.

**Adding new fitting problem definition types**

To add a new fitting problem type, it is a requirement that the parser name
can be derived from the file to be parsed.
This is done for all current file formats by including it as the first line
in the file. e.g ``# Fitbenchmark Problem`` or ``NIST/ITL StRD``.

To add a new fitting problem definition type, complete the following steps:

1. Give the format a name (``<format_name>``).
   This should be a single word or string of alphanumeric characters,
   and must be unique ignoring case.
2. Create a parser in the ``fitbenchmarking/parsing`` directory.
   This parser must satisfy the following:

   - Name of file should be of the form ``"<format_name>_parser.py"``
   - Parser must be a subclass of ``base_parser.Parser``
   - Parser must implement ``parse(self)`` method which takes only ``self``
     and returns a populated ``fitting_problem.FittingProblem``

   Note: File opening and closing is handled automatically.

3. If the format is unable to accommodate the current convention of
   starting with the ``<format_name>``, you will need to edit
   ``parser_factory.ParserFactory``.
   This should be done in such a way that the type is inferred from the file.
   e.g. If the type has a specific extension, the ``<format_name>`` could be
   made to match this, which future types could exploit.

4. Create the files to test the new parser.
   Automated tests are run against selected parsers in FitBenchmarking,
   these work by using test files in
   ``fitbenchmarking/parsing/tests/<format_name>``.
   In the ``generate_test_cases`` function, one needs to add the new parsers
   name to ``formats`` based on whether the parser is ``pip`` installable or
   not.
   There are 2 types of test files needed:

   - **Generic tests**: 1 file must be provided in the directory for each file
     in ``fitbenchmarking/parsing/tests/expected/``.
     This file must be in the new file format and will be parsed using the new
     parser to check that the entries in the generated fitting problem match
     the values in the ``expected`` file.

   - **Function tests**: 1 file can be provided in the directory to test that
     function evaluation is as expected. This file must be in json format and
     contain a string of the form::

       {"file_name1": [[x1, [param11, param21], result1],
                       [x2, [param12, param22], result2],
                       ...],
       {"file_name2": [...],
        ...}

     The test will then load the files in turn and run it against each item in
     the list, raising an issue if the result is not suitably close to the
     specified value.

   - **Integration tests**: Add an example to the `mock_problems/all_parser_test_set`.
     This will be used to verify that the problem can be run by scipy, and that
     accuracy results do not change unexpectedly in future changes to the code.

     As part of this, the `systests/expected/parsers.txt` file will need to be
     updated. This is done by running the systests::

       pytest fitbenchmarking/systests

     and then checking that the only difference between the results table and the
     expected value is the new problem, and replacing the expected with the result.

5. Verify that your tests have been found by running
   `pytest -vv fitbenchmarking/parsing/tests/test_parsers.py`
