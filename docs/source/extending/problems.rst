Adding Problem Groups
#####################

*This section describes how to add a problem group to the fit benchmarking
software. The default problem groups that come with this software are:
CUTEst, DIAMOND_SIF, Muon, Neutron, NIST, SAS_modelling, SIF, and simple_tests.*

1. Add your problem file directory in
   ``fitbenchmarking/benchmark_problems/``. Some examples of how this
   should look like are available in the same dir.

2. Run new problem group using the instructions found in :ref:`running`.
