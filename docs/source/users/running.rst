#######################
Running FitBenchmarking
#######################

Once installed, issuing the command

.. code-block:: bash

   fitbenchmarking

will run the NIST average difficulty problem set on SciPy minmizers.

By default, fitbenchmarking will start a Dash app in order to provide more
interactive plots. The Dash app will keep running after fitbenchmarking
has finished, unless it is stopped by the user. If the app is stopped,
the more interactive plots will not be available.

Running alternative problems
----------------------------

Other problems written in a :ref:`supported file format <problem_def>`
can be analyzed with FitBenchmarking by
passing the path using the ``-p`` or ``--problem-sets`` argument.
Example problems can be downloaded from
:ref:`BenchmarkProblems`, and they can also be found in the
``fitbenchmarking/examples`` directory of the code.

For example, to run the NIST low difficulty set from the base directory
of the source, type into the terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

   fitbenchmarking -p examples/benchmark_problems/NIST/low_difficulty

Changing the options
--------------------

An options file can also be passed with the ``-o`` or ``--options-file`` argument.
For example, the template file can be run by issuing the command

.. code-block:: bash

   fitbenchmarking -o examples/options_template.ini \
   -p examples/benchmark_problems/NIST/low_difficulty

Details about how the options file must be formatted are given in :ref:`options`.

Changing options via the command line
------------------------------

It is possible to change the following options via the command line rather than from an ``.ini`` file or from the default options.
They can be changed using the arguments in the table below.

**For example, to change the results directory:**

The default directory where the results are saved can be changed using the ``-r``
or ``--results-dir`` argument. The :ref:`results directory option <results_directory_option>`
can also be changed in the options file.

.. code-block:: bash

   fitbenchmarking -r new_results/

The default results directory is ``fitbenchmarking_results``.

**Multiple options**

For an option for which you wish to make several choices e.g. ``table_type``, simply use a space to separate your choices:

.. code-block:: bash

   fitbenchmarking -t acc runtime

If you wish to change several different options, use a space to separate the arguments:

.. code-block:: bash

   fitbenchmarking -t acc -l WARNING

**Help**

For more information on changing options via the command line, you can use the ``-h``
or ``--help`` argument.

.. code-block:: bash

   fitbenchmarking -h
