Running FitBenchmarking
#######################

A set of example problems can be found the ``fitbenchmarking/examples``
directory along with a template for passing in options.

To run with any of these problem sets, you should pass the path to the
`fitbenchmarking` command.

  e.g ``fitbenchmarking examples/benchmarking_problems/simple_tests``

An options file can also be passed with the ``-o`` argument.
The template in `examples` is heavily documented and serves as a good
reference for what options are available.

The `fitbenchmarking` function can also be called with ``-h`` to get
more help.
