 Benchmark problems
====================

To help choose between the different minimizers, we have made some curated
problems available to use with FitBenchmarking.  It is also straightforward to
add custom data sets to the benchmark, if that is more appropriate; see
:ref:`problem_def` for specifics of how to add additional problems in a
supported file format.

.. topic:: Downloads
	   
	   | **You can download a folder containing all examples here:** :download:`.zip <http://numerical.rl.ac.uk/fitbenchmarking/examples.zip>` or :download:`.tar.gz <http://numerical.rl.ac.uk/fitbenchmarking/examples.tar.gz>`
	   | Individual problem sets are also available to download below.

We supply some standard nonlinear least-squares test problems in the
form of the `NIST nonlinear regression set <https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/strd/nls/nls_main.shtml>`_
and the relevant problems from the `CUTEst problem set <https://github.com/ralna/CUTEst/wiki>`_,
together with some real-world 
data sets that have been extracted from `Mantid <https://www.mantidproject.org>`__ and
`SASView <https://www.sasview.org>`__ usage examples and system tests.
We've made it possible to extend this list by following the steps in 
:ref:`parsers`.

Each of the test problems contain:

* a data set consisting of points :math:`(x_i, y_i)` (with optional errors on :math:`y_i`, :math:`\sigma_i`);
* a definition of the fitting function, :math:`f({\boldsymbol{\beta}};x)`; and
* (at least) one set of initial values for the function parameters :math:`{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_0`.
  
If a problem doesnâ€™t have observational
errors (e.g., the NIST problem set), then FitBenchmarking can
approximate errors by taking :math:`\sigma_i = \sqrt{y_i}`.
Alternatively, there is an option to disregard errors and solve the
unweighted nonlinear least-squares problem, setting
:math:`\sigma_i = 1.0` irrespective of what has been passed in with the
problem data.

As we work with scientists in other areas, we will extend the problem
suite to encompass new categories. The FitBenchmarking framework has
been designed to make it easy to integrate new problem sets, and any
additional data added to the framework can be tested with any and all of
the available fitting methods.

Currently FitBenchmarking ships with data from the following sources:

Powder Diffraction Data (SIF files)
===================================

**Download** :download:`.zip <http://numerical.rl.ac.uk/fitbenchmarking/DIAMOND_SIF.zip>` or :download:`.tar.gz <http://numerical.rl.ac.uk/fitbenchmarking/DIAMOND_SIF.tar.gz>`

These problems (also found in the folder `examples/benchmark_problems/DIAMOND_SIF`)
contain data from powder diffraction experiments.  The data supplied comes
from the `I14 Hard X-Ray Nanoprobe <https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Imaging-and-Microscopy/I14.html>`_ beamline at
the Diamond Light source, and has been supplied in the SIF
format used by `CUTEst <https://github.com/ralna/CUTEst>`_.

spectrometer at ISIS, on which there are four fits available.
See :ref:`The MultiFit documentation<multifit>` for more details.

STFC's ISIS Neutron and Muon source, and has been supplied in the
format that `Mantid <https://mantidproject.org/>`__ uses to process
the data.

These problems have between 5 and 13 unknown parameters, and fit around 1,000 data points.
