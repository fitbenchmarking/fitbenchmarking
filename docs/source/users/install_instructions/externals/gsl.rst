Installing GSL
##############

GSL is used as a fitting software in FitBenchmarking.

Currently this is only supported for linux, and can be installed by running the
``build_gsl.sh`` script in the top level of the repository.

After installing GSL, use pip to install the python interface ``pyGSL``::

  pip install pygsl

For further details on installing cutest please visit the
`GSL docs <https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/>`__.
