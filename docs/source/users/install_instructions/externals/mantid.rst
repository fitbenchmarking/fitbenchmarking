Installing Mantid
#################

**Note: To use Mantid with python3, you need to run Mantid version 5.0.0
or higher.**

Windows
=======

The fitbenchmarking setup does not currently support installing mantid
through it. Mantid can be downloaded
`here <http://download.mantidproject.org/>`__. From the `Mantid
installation instructions
page <http://download.mantidproject.org/windows.html>`__:

The Windows installation steps below are for guidance only, and may need some
tweaking.

1. Download the installer and click **Run**.
2. Go through the steps of the installer. The default settings are
   recommended.
3. Once the installation process is complete a MantidPlot
   and MantidPython icon should appear on your desktop, and in your start menu.

Mantid ships a version of python with it, which by default it is installed in
`C:\\MantidInstall\\bin`.
FitBenchmarking can be installed using that version of Python.
Note pip is shipped with Mantid in the
`C:\\MantidInstall\\bin\\Scripts` folder.

**Note**: the installer will look for the drive with the most free disk
space, which may include external devices. Installing and uninstalling
on these devices is extremely slow, and not recommended.

Linux
=====

Installing Through the FitBenchmarking Tool
-------------------------------------------

The fitbenchmarking tool does support installing mantid through it on
Ubuntu 16.04 and Ubuntu 18.04. Open up a terminal and cd into the
fitbenchmarking folder. Here, type ``python setup.py help`` and follow
the instructions there to install mantid or any additional external
software. For clarity, it is as simple as running
``python setup.py externals -s mantid``

Manual Installation - Terminal
------------------------------

If for some reason this does not work for you, a manual installation
might instead. From the `Mantid installation instructions
page <http://download.mantidproject.org/ubuntu.html>`__

1. Open up a terminal
2. Run the following commands one line at a time::

      # add the mantid signing key
      wget -O - http://apt.isis.rl.ac.uk/2E10C193726B7213.asc | sudo apt-key add -
      sudo apt-add-repository "deb [arch=amd64] http://apt.isis.rl.ac.uk $(lsb_release -c | cut -f 2)-testing main"
      sudo apt-add-repository ppa:mantid/mantid

3. Install the package with::

      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install mantid

   This will install Mantid into ``/opt/Mantid`` and add bash files to
   ``/etc/profile.d`` so that next time you create a terminal the correct path
   to MantidPlot will be defined.

4. Add the location of Mantid's python files to your python path::

      PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/opt/Mantid/lib/:/opt/Mantid/bin/

**Note**: there is an example script of this in ``build/install/mantid.sh``.

Manual Installation - Package
-----------------------------

To download the package manually go
`here <http://download.mantidproject.org/>`__. To install a package
manually, first install gdebi: ``sudo apt-get install gdebi`` then
install mantid using: ``sudo gdebi pkgname.deb`` while you are in the
folder where you downloaded mantid and replace pkgname with the
name of the downloaded file.
