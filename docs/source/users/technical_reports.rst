On this page you will find links to Technical Reports that showcase new features, and
examples of how FitBenchmarking has been used for particular problems or for specific
scientific software packages.

Adding Bayesian Methods to FitBenchmarking
==========================================

DOI: `10.5286/stfctr.2026004 <https://doi.org/10.5286/stfctr.2026004>`__

This report outlines the Bayesian approach for parameter estimation which has been implemented
in FitBenchmarking.

Analysing SpinW 2D Powder Fitting
=================================

DOI: `10.5286/stfctr.2025001 <https://doi.org/10.5286/stfctr.2025001>`__

In this report, we utilise FitBenchmarking to analyse the performance of different implementations of fitting
algorithms for 2D powder averaging problems in SpinW, in particular examining the CrCl_2(pwm)
dataset. SpinW is a linear spin wave theory (LSWT) modelling code written in MATLAB, and its
sw_fitpowder class provides the capability to fit powder-averaged spectra to inelastic neutron scattering
(INS) data
