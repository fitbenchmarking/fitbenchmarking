===================
 Minimizer Options
===================

This section is used to declare the minimizers to use for each fitting
software. If a fitting software has been selected in :ref:`fitting_option`
then a default set of minimizers for that solver will be run unless alternative
minimizer options have been set. All minimizers for a software are included on
the default list of minimizers unless otherwise stated.

.. warning::

   Options set in this section will only have an effect if the related
   software is also set in :ref:`fitting_option` (either explicitly, or
   as a default option).

.. _bumps:

Bumps (:code:`bumps`)
=====================

`Bumps <https://bumps.readthedocs.io>`__ is a set of data fitting (and Bayesian uncertainty analysis) routines.
It came out of the University of Maryland and NIST as part of the DANSE
(*Distributed Data Analysis of Neutron Scattering Experiments*) project.

FitBenchmarking currently supports the Bumps minimizers:

* `Nelder-Mead Simplex <https://bumps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/optimizer.html#nelder-mead-simplex>`__ (:code:`amoeba`)

* `Levenberg-Marquardt <https://bumps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/optimizer.html#fit-lm>`__  (:code:`lm-bumps`) This is `mpfit`, a translation of `MINPACK` to Python.

* `Quasi-Newton BFGS <https://bumps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/optimizer.html#quasi-newton-bfgs>`__ (:code:`newton`)

* `Differential Evolution <https://bumps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/optimizer.html#differential-evolution>`__ (:code:`de`)

* `scipy's leastsq <https://bumps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/optimizer.html#fit-lm>`__ (:code:`scipy-leastsq`)  This calls scipy's Levenberg-Marquardt method. Note that this was the default method for `lm` prior to Bumps v0.8.2.

**Licence** The main licence file for Bumps is `here <https://github.com/bumps/bumps/blob/master/LICENSE.txt>`__.  Individual files have their own copyright and licence
-- if you plan to incorporate this in your own software you should first check that the
licences used are compatible.
  
**Links** `GitHub - bumps <https://github.com/bumps/bumps>`__

The Bumps minimizers are set as follows:

.. code-block:: rst

    [MINIMIZERS]
    bumps: amoeba
           lm-bumps
           newton
           de
           scipy-leastsq

.. warning::
   The additional dependency Bumps must be installed for this to be available;
   See :ref:`extra_dependencies`.	 

.. note::
   `de` is not included in the default list of minimizers for bumps. To run this solver, you must
   explicitly set the minimizer as seen above.

   The shgo solver is particularly slow running and should generally be avoided. As a result, this solver is
   not run by default when `scipy_go` software is selected. In order to run this minimizer, you must explicitly
   set it as above.
