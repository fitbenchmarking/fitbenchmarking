FitBenchmarking Options
#######################

FitBenchmarking is controlled by a set of options that are set in 2 places.
In order from lowest priority to highest these are:

- The default options.
- An options file.

The default options are a complete set of options with sensible values.
These will be used when no other values are given for any of the options,
the values for these can be seen in the links below.

    fitting_option
    plotting_option
    logging_option


The options file must be a `.ini` formatted file
(`see here <https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#supported-ini-file-structure>`__),
and a good reference for this can be
found in the examples, as well as at the bottom of this document.

See :ref:`options_extend` for new options.
