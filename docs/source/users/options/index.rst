FitBenchmarking Options
#######################

The default behaviour of FitBenchmarking can be changed by
supplying an options file.  The default values of these options,
and how to override them, are given in the pages below.

    :caption: Contents:

    fitting_option
    minimizer_option
    jacobian_option
    plotting_option
    logging_option


The options file must be a `.ini` formatted file
(`see here <https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#supported-ini-file-structure>`__),
and a good reference for this can be
found in the examples, as well as at the bottom of this document.

See :ref:`options_extend` for new options.
