FitBenchmarking Options
#######################

The default behaviour of FitBenchmarking can be changed by
supplying an options file.  The default values of these options,
and how to override them, are given in the pages below.

    :caption: Contents:

    fitting_option
    minimizer_option
    jacobian_option
    hessian_option
    output_option
    logging_option


The options file must be a ``.ini`` formatted file
(`see here <https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#supported-ini-file-structure>`__).
Some example files can be found in the ``examples`` folder of the source, which is also
available to download at :ref:`BenchmarkProblems`.
