FitBenchmarking Output
######################

FitBenchmarking produces tables and reports called support pages as outputs.
The links below give descriptions of these outputs.

Tables
******

.. toctree::
    :titlesonly:
    :maxdepth: 2

    compare
    acc
    runtime
    local_min
    emissions

Display modes
-------------

The tables for ``accuracy``, ``runtime``, ``emissions``, and ``compare`` have three display
modes:

.. prettyprintmodulevalue::
   :module: fitbenchmarking.results_processing.base_table
   :var: FORMAT_DESCRIPTION

This can be set in the option file using the
:ref:`Comparison Mode <ComparisonOption>` option.

The :ref:`local_min` table is formatted differently, and doesn't use this
convention.

Performance profile
-------------------

Below the table there is a :ref:`performance_profile`.

Assuming the Dash app is running (i.e., it has not been stopped by the user), the performance
profile is available in two versions:

* an offline version, which is always available and does not depend on the status of the Dash app
* an online version, which is more interactive than the offline version, but is only available if the Dash app is running.

The default version shown in the page is the offline one. The user can switch between the two
versions by clicking on the corresponding button above the plot. If the Dash app is off and the
graph currently open is the offline one, then clicking on the button for the online version will
have no effect. On the other hand, if the Dash app stops running while the online graph is shown,
then the graph will lose its interactivity, e.g., it will not be possible to change the x-axis scale.


Support Pages
*************

In each of the tables, a :ref:`fitting_report` for an individual result can be accessed
by clicking on the associated table cell. Clicking the problem name at the
start of a row will open a :ref:`problem_summary_page` for the problem as a whole.

.. toctree::
    :titlesonly:
    :hidden:
    :maxdepth: 2

    fitting_report
    problem_summary_pages
