Fitting Report
==============

The fitting report pages can be used to see more information about the problem
and a given fit.

Each page represents a single fitting combination and is split into 2 sections.

Problem Outline
***************

First is the initial problem. Here you will see information about the function
being fit and the set of initial parameters used for the fitting.
If plots are enabled (see :ref:`MakePlots`), you will also see a scatter plot
of the data to fit with a line of the initial fit given to the minimizer.

Fitting Results
***************

The second section focusses on the results of the fitting. Here you will find
the minimizer name and the final parameters for the fit found by the minimizer.
A plot of the fit is also shown with an overlaid best fit from whichever
minimizer was found to produce the smallest error.
