FitBenchmarking Tests
#####################

The tests for FitBenchmarking require ``pytest>=3.6``. We have split the tests
into three categories:

* ``default``: denotes tests involving ``pip`` installable
  :ref:`software packages<getting-started>`,
* ``all``: in addition to ``default``, also runs tests on
  :ref:`external packages <external-instructions>`, with the
  exception of matlab.
* ``matlab``: Runs tests for matlab fitting software. Please
  note that these tests can currently only be run locally
  through pytest.

Unit tests
----------

Each module directory in FitBenchmarking (e.g. ``controllers``) contains a
test folder which has the ``unit`` tests for that module.
One can run the tests for a module by:

.. code-block:: bash

   pytest fitbenchmarking/<MODULE_DIR> --test-type <TEST_TYPE>

where <TEST_TYPE> is either ``default`` or ``all``.
If ``--test-type`` argument is not given the default is ``all``

System tests
------------

System tests can be found in the ``systests`` directory in FitBenchmarking.
As with the unit tests, these can be run via:

.. code-block:: bash

   pytest fitbenchmarking/systests --test-type <TEST_TYPE>


.. warning::
   The files in the expected results subdirectory of the ``systests``
   directory are generated to check consistency in our automated tests via
   `GitHub Actions <https://github.com/fitbenchmarking/fitbenchmarking/actions>`__.
   They might not pass on your local operating system due to, for example,
   different software package versions being installed.

GitHub Actions tests
---------------------

The scripts that are used for our automated tests via
`GitHub Actions <https://github.com/fitbenchmarking/fitbenchmarking/actions>`__
are located in the ``ci`` folder.
These give an example of how to run both the unit and system tests within
FitBenchmarking.
