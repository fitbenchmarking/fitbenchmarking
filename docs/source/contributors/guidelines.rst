Contributor Guidelines:
=======================

Linting:
^^^^^^^^

All pull requests should be pep8 compliant.
We suggest running code through flake8 and pylint before submitting to check for this.



Documentation:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any new code will be accepted only if there is relevent documentation for it in the corresponding pull request.


Git:
^^^^

Branches should be created from master, and by convention follow the pattern "nnn_description" where nnn is the issue number.
