# Summary

Fitting a mathematical model to data is a fundamental task across all scientific disciplines. [`FitBenchmarking`](https://fitbenchmarking.com/) has been designed to help:

* Scientists, who want to know the best algorithm for fitting their data to a given model using specific hardware.
* Scientific software developers, who want to identify the best fitting algorithms and implementations. This allows them to recommend a default solver, to see if it is worth adding a new minimizer, and to test their implementation.
* Mathematicians and numerical software developers, who want to understand the types of problems on which current algorithms do not perform well, and to have a route to expose newly developed methods to users.

Representatives of each of these communities have got together to build `FitBenchmarking`. We hope this tool will help foster fruitful interactions and collaborations across the disciplines.

![Benchmarking paradigm: associating fitting problems represented in individual scientific software packages (top cycle) to optimization software packages (bottom cycle), and bringing these closer together. \label{fig:concept}](figures/FitBenchmarkingConcept.png){width=60%}

`FitBenchmarking` is easy to install via `pip` and our [documentation](https://fitbenchmarking.com/) guides users through the installation of some external packages we support. We provide several data sets from a range of applications and adding new data in these formats is as easy as dropping the data into a new folder. The data and fitting packages currently supported are shown in Figure \ref{fig:concept}. A key part of `FitBenchmarking` is the ease of which a user, with a basic knowledge of `Python`, can add new fitting software, data formats and different fitting comparison output metrics.


# Statement of need

`FitBenchmarking` originally started as a tool to benchmark fitting algorithms in the data reduction package `Mantid` [@mantid], which is used to process neutron scattering and muon spectroscopy data. `FitBenchmarking` has since been significantly extended to take data and models from other real world applications and data analysis / modelling / treatment packages, such as `SasView` [@sasview] and `CUTEst` [@cutest]. It fits models to the data by using a range of data fitting and nonlinear optimization software packages, and present comparisons through a variety of different metrics. These include comparison tables and performance profile plots.

`FitBenchmarking` compares how different fitting algorithms perform for the same data, model and initial guess. The best parameters for the model are found by solving a nonlinear least-squares problem, which can either be solved via a fitting package or an off the shelf minimizer. Figure \ref{fig:sample} displays a data set from `FitBenchmarking` where the crosses are the data points and the two curves are the fits found by two optimization algorithms implemented in `GSL` [@gsl]. From Figure \ref{fig:sample}, it is clear that the solution given by lmsder is better. As the volume of data increases, and we do more and more data analysis algorithmically, it is increasingly important that we have the best algorithm without needing to check it by eye. `FitBenchmarking` generates HTML output that makes it easy to compare minimizers on a given problem set.

![A sample fit: this problem is shipped with `FitBenchmarking`. The data was collected from an instrument named VESUVIO at the ISIS Neutron and Muon Source and has a difficult initial guess. \label{fig:sample}](figures/nmsimplex2_fit_for_EVS14188-90_processed_Gaussian_peaks_1_1.png){width=70%}

`FitBenchmarking` will help the scientist make an informed choice by comparing runtime and accuracy of all available minimizers, on their specific hardware, on problems from their science area.

`FitBenchmarking` will help the scientific software developer ensure that the most robust and quickest algorithms for the type of data analysis they support are available in their software.

`FitBenchmarking` will help mathematicians see what the state of the art is, and what kinds of data are problematic. It will give them access to real data, and will give a route for novel methods to quickly make it into production.
